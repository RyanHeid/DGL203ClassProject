        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
          <p>This is a proposal to build a website for my client, Robert Smith. Robert is looking to grow awareness of his business, show potential clients his work and sell prints to customers. </p>
          <p>
           Robert has requested a Home, Galleries, Shop, and Contact page. On the home page, he would like a large black and white image, with his business name (Robert Smith) photography to the middle right, and the navigation bar to the lower right of the page. At the top right of the page, he would like his URL listed. (RobertSmith.com) The second page will be the galleries page. Robert has requested a secondary navigation under the main navigation that will have the subheadings Pets, Weddings, and People. I am going to use Grid to display the images in these subdirectories to create better alignment and balance. The Shop page is going to have two image carousels that will contain images of prints that Robert would like to sell. Robert has requested a form on the right-hand side of this page. This form will require the customer to select the image they want to buy and its size. After selection, the customer enters their name and email address, which is then submitted. Robert receives the form via email, and then fulfills the customers purchase. The last page of the website will be the contact page. This page asks for the visitors first and last name and email address. There is a subject line, message box and submit button. Robert has also requested animated buttons; something a little different than the norm, and something to help his page stand out from others. Robert liked the ideas that I had suggested and said he will contact me later in the week with his decision.</p> 
           <p>The projected completion date for this project is November 21, 2022. </p>
